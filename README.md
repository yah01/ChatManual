# ChatManual

ChatManual is a programming mannual with ChatGPT, it is more powerful than the `man` command, as `cman` could provide information about any programming language, and works well for the std lib and popular lib.

## Install
```shell
go install github.com/yah01/cman@latest
```

## Usage
First you need to set the env var `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key, or run with 
```shell
cman -api="{your API key}"
```

Lookup manual about `mmap`
```shell
$ cman mmap

The mmap function in programming is used to map a file or device into memory. This allows for direct access to the data in the file or device, without the need for reading or writing to it. 

The mmap function is commonly used in operating systems and low-level programming, as it allows for efficient memory management and access to data. It can also be used in high-level programming languages, such as Python, to work with large files or datasets. 

Overall, the mmap function is a powerful tool for working with files and devices in programming, and can greatly improve performance and efficiency.

Request short answer by flag `-s`:
```shell
$ cman -s mmap                                                                              
mmap stands for memory-mapped file. It is a technique used in computer programming that allows a file to be accessed as if it were part of the computer's memory. This means that data can be read from or written to the file using standard memory access operations, rather than having to use file I/O functions. mmap is commonly used in operating systems and databases to improve performance and reduce the amount of I/O operations needed to access data.

mmap stands for memory-mapped file. It is a system call in Unix-like operating systems that allows a file to be mapped into memory, providing direct access to the file's contents as if it were an array in memory.

Here is an example of how to use mmap in Python to read the contents of a file:

```python
import mmap

# Open a file for reading
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    # Memory-map the file, size 0 means whole file
    mmapped_file = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, prot=mmap.PROT_READ)
    
    # Read the contents of the file
    contents = mmapped_file.read()
    
    # Close the memory-mapped file
    mmapped_file.close()
    
    # Print the contents of the file
    print(contents)
```

In this example, we open a file "file.txt" for reading and use mmap to memory-map the file. We then read the contents of the file using the memory-mapped file object and print it to the console. Finally, we close the memory-mapped file object.

You may notice that this answers about python, not the expected C system call.

In C, `mmap` is a system call that allows a program to map a file or device into memory. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as reading and writing large files, implementing shared memory between processes, or creating memory-mapped I/O devices.

Here's an example of how to use `mmap` to read the contents of a file into memory:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int fd;
    char *data;
    struct stat sb;

    if (argc < 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <file>\n", argv[0]);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("open");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (fstat(fd, &sb) == -1) {
        perror("fstat");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    data = mmap(NULL, sb.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
    if (data == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("mmap");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("%s", data);

    if (munmap(data, sb.st_size) == -1) {
        perror("munmap");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    close(fd);
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
```

In this example, we first open the file specified by the command-line argument using the `open` system call. We then use `fstat` to get information about the file, such as its size. 

Next, we call `mmap` to map the file into memory. The `NULL` argument tells `mmap` to choose the address at which to map the file, `sb.st_size` specifies the size of the mapping, `PROT_READ` specifies that we only need read access to the mapping, `MAP_PRIVATE` specifies that changes to the mapping should not be visible to other processes, `fd` is the file descriptor returned by `open`, and `0` specifies the offset within the file to start the mapping.

We can then access the contents of the file as a character array pointed to by `data`.

Finally, we call `munmap` to unmap the file from memory and close the file descriptor using `close`.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Sure, I can explain mmap in C.

mmap() is a system call in C that is used to map a file or device into memory. It allows a process to access a file or device as if it were an array in memory, which can be very useful for certain types of applications.

The function signature for mmap() is:

```
void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);
```

Here is a brief description of the parameters:

- `addr`: This is the starting address for the mapping. If it is NULL, the kernel will choose a suitable address.
- `length`: This is the length of the mapping in bytes.
- `prot`: This specifies the protection of the mapping. It can be a combination of `PROT_READ`, `PROT_WRITE`, and `PROT_EXEC`.
- `flags`: This specifies various flags that control the behavior of the mapping. It can be a combination of `MAP_SHARED`, `MAP_PRIVATE`, `MAP_FIXED`, and others.
- `fd`: This is the file descriptor of the file to be mapped. If `MAP_ANONYMOUS` is set in `flags`, this parameter is ignored.
- `offset`: This is the offset within the file to start the mapping.

Once the mapping is established, the process can access the file or device as if it were an array in memory. Any changes made to the memory will be reflected in the file or device, and vice versa.

Overall, mmap() is a powerful tool for working with files and devices in C, and can be used in a variety of applications.
